# hello-world

Hello world, this is Jeff. I have created this repository as part of the curriculum at the Odin Project. Currently, I am taking that course as well as Free Code Camp. I am also working toward a degree in Computer Science but have had to take a couple semesters off which led me to start working on my own.
